This is a code-guessing game written in Python.
I have seen it called many names, like Cows and Bulls, but I call it Mastermind.
The computer thinks of a 4-digit code, like 5912, and you have to guess it.
With each guess, you are scored:
    X means a right digit in the right place, like 5732 - XX
    o means a right digit, but in the wrong place, like 7825 - oo
    Often there is a mixture, like 5726 - Xo - one digit is in the right place,
    one is in the wrong place, and two aren't in the code at all. The order
    of Xs and os is random, so you don't know which digit they are for.
